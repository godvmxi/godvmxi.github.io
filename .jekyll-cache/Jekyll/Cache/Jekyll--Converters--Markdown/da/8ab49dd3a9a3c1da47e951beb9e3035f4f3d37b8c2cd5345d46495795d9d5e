<p>Hi, I am Bright Jiang, a  software engineer . My interests range from programming languages in general (type system, type-based formal verification, compilers, runtime systems, garbage collection) to indurstial software engineering (web/mobile app development, user interface and UX, developer infrastructure and DX).</p>

<p>In the past, I worked on <a href="https://www.alitrip.com/">Alitrip (Fliggy)</a> mobile and web apps under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba Group</a>, found and lead front-end infrastructure team at a unicorn startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beijing-weiying-technology">Beijing Weiying (WePiao)</a>, and helped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ele.me">Ele.me</a> to upgrade their mobile web into <a href="https://medium.com/elemefe/upgrading-ele-me-to-progressive-web-app-2a446832e509">the first influential PWA (progressive web app) in China</a>.</p>

<p>I studied BA, Digital Media Art at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_University_of_China">Communication University of China</a> and MS, Computer Science with a focus on programming languages at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages.   I know, I know this could be very contraversial. But it’s a quite self-entertaining side project to do right? So have fun and don’t take it too serious!</p>
