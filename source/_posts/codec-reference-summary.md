# Code talk
I summary all main video codecs JM/HM to github, you can find in : [JM/HM](https://github.com/godvmxi/codec_refer_code)
# Why do this useless work
The code can only build in the the legacy GCC, so I modify it to adapt to the modern GCC.
# JVET REPO
[JVET REPO](https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet)
All the codec reference code has been moved into a gitlab account (JVET), you can find all origin code.
